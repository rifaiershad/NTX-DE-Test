## Data Understanding

The dataset `nice-argon-345513.ntx_de.ntx_de_test` appears to contain e-commerce transaction data, including information about user visits, product interactions, and revenue generation across different countries and channels.

Key fields analyzed:
- `country`: The country where the transaction occurred
- `channelGrouping`: The channel through which the user accessed the site
- `totalTransactionRevenue`: The total revenue generated from a transaction
- `fullVisitorId`: Unique identifier for each visitor
- `timeOnSite`: Time spent by a visitor on the site
- `pageviews`: Number of pages viewed by a visitor
- `sessionQualityDim`: A metric indicating the quality of a user's session
- `v2ProductName`: Name of the product
- `productQuantity`: Quantity of a product sold

## Data Quality Issues

1. Missing Data:
   - The following columns contain no data: productRefundAmount, productRevenue, productVariant, itemQuantity, itemRevenue, transactionRevenue, transactionId, searchKeyword

2. Non-Standard Formatting:
   - `timeOnSite`: Stored as numbers without indication of units (assumed to be seconds)
   - `totalTransactionRevenue`: Stored as large numbers without clear indication of scale (appears to be in millionths of the currency unit)
   - `date`: Stored in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20160901) instead of a standard date format
   - `productPrice`: Format unclear from the provided information

3. Other Issues:
   - Potential inconsistency in currency units across different fields
   - Possible outliers or extreme values in revenue and time-related fields
   - Lack of clear documentation on the meaning and units of certain fields

Insights:
1. The query identifies the top 5 countries by total transaction revenue.
2. For each of these countries, it breaks down the revenue by channel grouping.
3. Revenue is formatted in billions of USD, suggesting very high transaction volumes or potential issues with data scaling.

Key Takeaways:
- We can identify which channels are most effective in the top-performing countries.
- The use of billions as a unit suggests either extremely high revenue or potential data scaling issues that need investigation.

### Task 2: User Behavior Analysis

| fullVisitorId      | avg_time_on_site | avg_pageviews | avg_session_quality |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 3.490247e+18       | 4914.0           | 31.0          | 9.0                 |
| 6.036794e+18       | 1616.0           | 13.0          | 38.0                |

Insights:
1. The query focuses on users who spend above-average time on the site but view fewer pages than average.
2. It provides average time on site, pageviews, and session quality for these users.

Key Takeaways:
- We can identify users who spend a lot of time on few pages, which could indicate either deep engagement or potential usability issues.
- This analysis could help in understanding user engagement patterns and potentially improving site navigation or content.

Insights:
1. The query identifies the top 10 products by total transaction revenue.
2. It provides the total revenue (in billions USD) and quantity sold for each product.

Key Takeaways:
- We can identify the best-selling products both in terms of revenue and quantity.
- The use of billions as a unit again suggests either extremely high revenue or potential data scaling issues.
- Comparing revenue to quantity sold can give insights into high-value vs. high-volume products.

## Recommendations

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Investigate and potentially impute or remove rows with missing data in critical columns.
   - Standardize date and time formats across the dataset.

2. Data Validation:
   - Verify the units and scaling of monetary values, especially given the billion-dollar figures.
   - Ensure consistency of units across different monetary and time-related fields.

3. Enhanced Analysis:
   - Consider time-based trends in channel performance and product sales.
   - Analyze the relationship between session quality, time on site, and revenue generation.
   - Investigate potential seasonal patterns in sales and user behavior.

4. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive data dictionary explaining the meaning, unit, and possible values of each field.

5. Data Collection Improvement:
   - Address the issue of empty columns by either fixing data collection processes or removing unnecessary fields.

By addressing these data quality issues and expanding on the current analyses, we can gain more accurate and actionable insights from this e-commerce dataset.
